- Built an **Interest Rate Calculator** that takes in Principal Amount, Rate of Interest, and Number of Years of Investment. It outputs the interest gained at the end.

- Found out that **calling `gcc` with a `.cpp` file will compile it as C++ source**, but linking will fail if standard C++ libraries are required.
